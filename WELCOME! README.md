# Hello, welcome to my SQl-Portfolio!
This code repository contains a collection of SQL scripts that I have created for various analysis and database management tasks. The scripts in this portfolio cover a wide range of topics, including data cleaning and manipulation and database design and optimization, 

In addition to the the SQL scripts, this repository also includes sample datasets that I have used to test and demonstrate the functionality of the scripts. The datasets cover various domains, such as sales, customer data, and inventory management. 

Thank you for visiting!
